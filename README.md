### Hi, Welcome To My Github Profile ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹
#
I'm Mert, I'm working on Android application development. I am sharing my projects here. I usually use the Kotlin programming language for Android projects. I am also a writer in the MobilerDev community and as the mobile team captain, I provide support to people who work on Android application development whenever I can, in FUTAG, a club of our school.
